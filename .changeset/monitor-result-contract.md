Replace raw progress-log streaming with result-contract monitoring. `monitor_start` now requires `result_pattern`, supports an optional `failure_pattern`, scans stdout and stderr without injecting progress into model context, and emits one structured terminal result with a bounded diagnostic tail. Remove the model-facing `monitor_read` output reader so agents wait for the contracted terminal notification instead of polling.
