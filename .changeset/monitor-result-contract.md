Replace raw progress-log streaming with result-contract monitoring. `monitor_start` now requires `result_pattern`, supports an optional `failure_pattern`, scans stdout and stderr without injecting progress into model context, and emits one structured terminal result. Add `monitor_read` for bounded, on-demand diagnostics and retain recent completed monitor output for inspection.
