Render `list_directory_sessions` with the shared compact tool display pattern: self-rendered shell, empty call slot, and one `[sessions] listed · N other sessions in <dir>` result row styled like monitor terminal events (custom-message label color on the custom-message background). Expanding reveals a bounded block per session with status, pid, relative age, goal, recap, and recent files; every display field is sanitized with the new shared `safeDisplayText` and truncated to bounded lengths.

Registry reads now normalize untrusted records on read (numeric pid/timestamps, known status union), merge records from multiple writers (extension state and keyboard glow state use different id conventions) into one logical session per owning process, and exclude records owned by the current process regardless of id, so counts and listings are no longer doubled.
