# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Best Practices

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, quality assurance testers, and customer representatives in a software project.

## 1. The Core Lifecycle: Discovery, Formulation, Automation

Modern BDD (2024+) emphasizes that BDD is about *conversations* first, automation second.

### Discovery (The "Three Amigos")
Before writing code or tests, the "Three Amigos" (Business/PO, Developer, Tester) meet to discuss the feature.
*   **Goal:** Shared understanding.
*   **Method:** Structured conversations, often using techniques like **Example Mapping**.
*   **Output:** Concrete examples of how the system should behave.

### Formulation (Gherkin)
Convert those examples into structured scenarios using Gherkin syntax (Given/When/Then).
*   **Goal:** Executable specifications / Living Documentation.
*   **Standard:** Write *declarative* scenarios that describe business behavior, not UI implementation details.
*   **Reference:** See [Gherkin Guide](./gherkin-guide.md).

### Automation (BDD-Driven TDD / Red-Green-Refactor)
Implement the scenarios using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

## 2. The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

This is the engine of implementation.

### RED: Write a Failing Test
*   **The Rule:** No production code is written without a failing test.
*   **The Check:** Run the test. It *must* fail. If it passes, your test is broken or the feature already exists.
*   **Best Practice:** Write small, targeted tests. Focus on one behavior at a time.

### GREEN: Make it Pass
*   **The Goal:** Write the *minimal* amount of code to make the test pass.
*   **The Mindset:** "Make it work." Do not optimize yet. Do not over-engineer.
*   **YAGNI:** You Ain't Gonna Need It. Don't add fields or logic not required by the current test.

### REFACTOR: Make it Clean
*   **The Goal:** Improve code structure without changing behavior.
*   **The Safety Net:** The green test ensures you don't break functionality while cleaning up.
*   **Actions:** Remove duplication, improve naming, extract methods, apply patterns.

## 3. General Best Practices

*   **Shift Left:** Testing happens *during* development, not after.
*   **Living Documentation:** Your feature files should be readable by business stakeholders and serve as the source of truth.
*   **One Scenario, One Behavior:** Keep scenarios focused.
*   **Integration:** Run BDD scenarios in your CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Test Behavior, Not Implementation:** Tests should survive refactoring. If renaming a private variable breaks a test, the test was too coupled to implementation.

## 4. BDD-Driven TDD (Automation)

In this plugin, TDD is always **BDD-driven** — the Automation phase of the BDD lifecycle:

*   **BDD** (`/skill:bdd`) — Discovery (conversations → examples) → Formulation (Gherkin scenarios) → Automation (BDD-driven red-green loop).
*   **TDD** (`/skill:tdd`) — The BDD-driven Automation phase reference: test quality, seams, mocking, anti-patterns, and the red-green loop rules. It is invoked during `/skill:bdd` and `/skill:implement` for test implementation guidance.
*   **Usage:** BDD defines *what* to build (the Gherkin scenarios). BDD-driven TDD ensures the *implementation* is correct and robust via the red-green loop. They are a unified pipeline, not two practices.

## 5. Iron Law Exceptions

The Iron Law ("no production code without a failing test first") has exactly three legitimate exceptions — and even these should be raised with the user, not silently assumed:

*   **One-off prototypes** — throwaway code answering a design question (see `/skill:prototype`). It will be deleted, not shipped, so a regression guard adds nothing. If the prototype survives into the real codebase, the Iron Law re-applies.
*   **Generated code** — output of a code generator or scaffolder where the *generator* is the system under test, not the generated artifact. Test the generator's contract; the generated files are downstream artifacts, not hand-written behavior.
*   **Config files** — declarative configuration (`.feature` step definitions aside) that carries no executable behavior of its own. A misconfigured file fails at load time or via an integration test; a unit test against its literal contents would be tautological.

Everything else writes a failing test first. "Too simple," "already verified manually," and "pragmatic not dogmatic" are rationalizations, not exceptions — see the Iron Law table in `SKILL.md`.
