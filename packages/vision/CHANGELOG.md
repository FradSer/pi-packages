# @fradser/pi-vision

## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- 9cabb0d: Bump every package by one patch version.
- efd5641: Declare the pi core packages these extensions already use as `"*"` peer dependencies instead of resolving them by hoisting, per pi's package guide: `typebox` for pi-kit, impeccable, matt-pocock, and utils; `@earendil-works/pi-ai` for plan-mode, recap, and skill-router; `@earendil-works/pi-tui` for plan-mode, skill-router, and vision; and `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` for pi-kit, whose best-effort worker CLI probe resolves it at runtime. `import type` counts because pi packages ship TypeScript source that a consumer's type-checker must resolve. impeccable no longer bundles `typebox` in `dependencies`, since pi provides core packages. A pi-kit check now fails when a package uses a core package without declaring it as a `"*"` peer or when a core package ships as a dependency.
- efd5641: Make pi-kit own the whole live-activity status row, so no package can drift. The widget now formats the identity itself — bold in pi-kit's stable per-name accent palette, the same one `@name` segments use in report rows — and replaces the free-form `formatIdentity`/`formatActivity` hooks with one closed vocabulary: `activityFormat: "plain"` (muted, literal, unchanged default) or `"markdown"` (one sanitized line through pi-tui's Markdown with the injected theme's native markdown tokens; foreign ANSI is stripped, a streamed fence line is dropped, activity without visible width leaves an identity-only row, and the widget row truncates with `fit`). `renderLiveActivityIdentity`, `liveActivityMarkdownTheme`, and `renderLiveActivityMarkdown` are exported so console rows render identity and activity the same way instead of reimplementing either one.
  
  Context research and agent-teams teammate rows both request markdown activity: identified rows stop being colorless or warning-colored, well-formed markdown renders with the theme's tokens instead of literal markup, and status rows above the editor are now the same language in every package. agent-teams' console delegates to the shared renderer with a passthrough theme instead of keeping a second markdown implementation, and its roster, board, and report rows use the same per-agent accent for names and ids instead of a status-flavored palette. Every package that mounts a live widget is republished so it picks up the new pi-kit.

### Patch Changes

- Standardize runtime package entry points on package-root `index.ts` modules. The monitor status is also rendered through Pi's native footer so it appears below the directory and usage lines.
- Updated dependencies
  - @fradser/pi-kit@0.1.1

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 3c88ab4: Introduce `@fradser/pi-kit` as the shared internal runtime package and remove duplicated TUI, message, and model-selection helpers across consumers:
  
  - Spinner frames/interval (`PI_SPINNER_FRAMES`, `PI_SPINNER_INTERVAL_MS`) come from pi-kit in agent-teams, memory, recap, and vision.
  - The overlay/console theme style language (`createPiThemeStyle`) comes from pi-kit in btw and agent-teams; `BtwOverlayStyle` aliases `PiThemeStyle`.
  - Message text extraction (`extractTextContent`) comes from pi-kit in btw, recap, vision, utils, and agent-teams.
  - Model selection (`parseModelRef`, `modelRef`, `modelLabel`, `sortModels`, `selectModelFromMenu`, `enterModelFromInput`) comes from pi-kit in memory, recap, and vision.
  - monitor's hand-rolled escape-key check now uses pi-tui's `matchesKey(data, Key.escape)`.
  
  Also fixes a packaging/loading bug in `@fradser/pi-memory`: `config.ts` moved into `extensions/` (it was outside the shipped `files` and the directory-glob the extension loader used), and the `pi.extensions` entry now points at `./extensions/inject-memory.ts` so pi loads exactly the factory file and treats `config.ts` as a helper module.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- f4fccb1: Republish all published package versions through GitHub CI to align with current release flow and regenerate their release metadata after version comparison.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f440d38: Bridge images returned from tool execution results (such as `read` on image files or screenshots) to the configured vision model when using text-only models.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 001441d: Add a transparent image-to-text bridge that lets text-only Pi models use a configured vision model for image prompts.
