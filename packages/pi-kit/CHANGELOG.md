# @fradser/pi-kit

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d37028f: Unify collapsible event rows on the shared pi-kit expand hint and fix the teammate shutdown label: `teammate_shutdown` now renders one `[agent] event · @name shut down` row (previously mislabeled as a monitor event) whose collapsed line appends the same dim ` · <configured key> to expand` hint as teammate report rows, with the shutdown details (exit code, released tasks, usage) revealed behind expansion. `formatExpandHint` moves the hint language into `@fradser/pi-kit`, replacing the hand-rolled variants in agent-teams, monitor, and utils. Leader `send_message` adopts the same single-row lifecycle pattern: the call slot renders nothing and one `[message] to @name · delivered|queued` row carries the outcome (plus a dim stalled-duration suffix), replacing the duplicated call-plus-sentence transcript rows. `task_create` gets the same treatment with a `[board] created · <subject>` row; all leader tool renderers now key failures off pi's render-context `isError` flag instead of the result object. A teammate's completion entry ("Teammate @name finished.") is announced once per spawn incarnation: reports now carry the spawn identity, so repeated terminal-status messages from one resident render as ordinary report rows instead of duplicate finished lines, while a respawned teammate of the same name announces again.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 50c45ff: Share compact tool lifecycle labels through pi-kit and standardize monitor startup and terminal event rendering.
- 7ad11b4: Render `list_directory_sessions` with the shared compact tool display pattern: self-rendered shell, empty call slot, and one `[sessions] listed · N other sessions in <dir>` result row styled like monitor terminal events (custom-message label color on the custom-message background). Expanding reveals a bounded block per session with status, pid, relative age, goal, recap, and recent files; every display field is sanitized with the new shared `safeDisplayText` and truncated to bounded lengths.
  
  Registry reads now normalize untrusted records on read (numeric pid/timestamps, known status union), merge records from multiple writers (extension state and keyboard glow state use different id conventions) into one logical session per owning process, and exclude records owned by the current process regardless of id, so counts and listings are no longer doubled.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Standardize runtime package entry points on package-root `index.ts` modules. The monitor status is also rendered through Pi's native footer so it appears below the directory and usage lines.
